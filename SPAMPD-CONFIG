Install spampd: apt install spampd

spampd configuration is found in /etc/default/spampd

Need an iptables rule for forwarding/redirecting incoming mail to 127.0.0.1:10025
  iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -i enp0s3 --dport 25 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:10025
And a sysctl directive to enable forwarding of traffic to the loopback network:
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1

Need to install netfilter-persistent to make firewall rule effective after reboot:
  apt install netfilter-persistent
