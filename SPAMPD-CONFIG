Install spampd: apt install spampd

spampd configuration is found in /etc/default/spampd

And a sysctl directive to enable forwarding of traffic to the loopback network:
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1 (only temporary, won't survive reboot)
  echo 'net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf   ...to make permanent.

Have configured Thunderbird to respect spampd headers and move spam messages to Junk folder.
